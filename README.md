# US Airlines Tweets Sentiment Visualization Using Streamlit

This project aims to show how we can use streamlit to build a great dashboard with a lot of interactivities and good visualizations. In this project, we are going to use datasets from Kaggle US Airlines Tweets Sentiment (called Tweets.csv).

## Setup
install all the requirement libraries in the requirements_streamlit.txt using command :
```
pip install -r requirements_streamlit.txt
```

We suggest the reader to use a dedicated virtual environment when working on this project to avoid any mismatching library version during install. So before installing all the requirements, make the virtual environment using these following commands :
```
## make the dedicated venv
python -m venv your_project_name

## to enter the venv
source your_project_name/bin/activate
```
